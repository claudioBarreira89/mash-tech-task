To run the project first run "npm install" then "npm start"

I've added unit tests to:

- Amount component in "src/components/Amount/"
- TermsSection component in "src/containers/TermsSection/"

"npm run test" to run unit tests and "npm run coverage" to run tests and check code coverage

To create a distribution bundle just run "npm run build" and a "dist" folder with the bundle will be created
